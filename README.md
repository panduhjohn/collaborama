#  Hey Em, if you could go anywhere in the world, all-inclusive, where would you go?

#  If all-inclusive, then probably Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, because I'll never have the money to go there



# If you could learn one skill from beginner to pro in one second, what would it be?

# Probaby how to start my own business and the ins and out of everything included. 



# How would you have ended GoT? That ending was awful...

# I was hoping for more democratic ending (since the iron throne was gone and all), but pretty much anything else would've been better than Bran becoming the king..



# Batman or Superman

# Batman, just not Ben Affleck Batman.



# If you had to pick your own entrance music, for some reason, what song would you pick?

# Something super tacky like Rocky Balboa theme



# One place you wanna base-jump but can't (or maybe you can but it's illegal or something)?

# haha all the good ones are illegal. The tall one around the corner from school with the crane...



# Whats your top 3 “bucket list” items?

# 1. visit all the continents (only Antarctica left)    2. learn a backflip     3. travel north america in a van



# TV show that everyone should watch

# Shameless, best show ever.



# Alright last one, Why do you want to code?

# I need another career (not just some random jobs) to support my poorly paid acting career.



# So you're gonna get those airpods tomorrow then :D?
