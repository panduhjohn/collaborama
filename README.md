#  Hey Em, if you could go anywhere in the world, all-inclusive, where would you go?

#  If all-inclusive, then probably Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, because I'll never have the money to go there



# If you could learn one skill from beginner to pro in one second, what would it be?

# Probaby how to start my own business and the ins and out of everything included.

# I was hoping for more democratic ending (since the iron throne was gone and all), but pretty much anything else would've been better than Bran becoming the king..


# Batman or Superman

# Batman, just not Ben Affleck Batman.
    If you had to pick your own entrance music, for some reason, what song would you pick?
